# SUPABASE EDGE FUNCTION ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
# ========================================
# These are NOT set in your .env file!
# Instead, set these directly in your Supabase project dashboard:
# Go to: Project Settings → Edge Functions → Environment Variables
#
# ARBITRUM_RPC_URL=https://arb1.arbitrum.io/rpc
# ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY=your_admin_private_key_here
#
# CRITICAL SECURITY NOTE:
# - ADMIN_PRIVATE_KEY must be the private key of the wallet that owns the RewardDistributor contract
# - This wallet needs sufficient ETH for gas fees
# - NEVER commit this private key to version control
# - Keep this key secure and rotate it regularly
